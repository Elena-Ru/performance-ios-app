Farmers produced approximately 77 million tonnes of palm oil in 2018 alone. This figure is expected to rise to 107.6 million tonnes by 2024, ramping up pressure on rainforests, vast sections of which have already been razed to the ground across South America and Asia to make way for palm oil estates. This is destroying the homes of endangered animals, notably orangutans, Sumatran rhinos, and pygmy elephants, pushing them even closer to the brink of extinction.", photos: ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4MLyNZ66GSMUp7z49Q8k3K-320-80.jpg"], likeCount: 1, userLikes: 1, commentCount: 0),
